# Exciting News from the All in Open Source Program! ðŸŒŸ
I'm thrilled to share my journey through the All in Open Source program backed by GitHub! ðŸš€ It's been an incredible experience so far, filled with learning, collaboration, and meaningful connections.

Being a part of this program has been nothing short of amazing. I've had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of open source, contributing to fascinating projects and learning from some of the best minds in the community. The support and resources provided by GitHub have truly been invaluable, empowering me to grow as a developer and make a real impact in the open source ecosystem.

One of the highlights of my journey was participating in a recent Hackathon in collaboration with MLH (Major League Hack). It was an exhilarating experience where I had the chance to put my skills to the test, collaborate with talented peers, and bring an innovative idea to life.

Together with my team, we embarked on the journey of creating an e-wallet with a stunning UI. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished in such a short amount of time. From brainstorming ideas to coding and designing, every moment was filled with excitement and creativity.

I'm truly grateful for the opportunities that the All in Open Source program and GitHub have provided me. I look forward to continuing my journey in the open-source community, collaborating with fellow developers, and making a positive impact through my work.

Here's to many more exciting adventures ahead! ðŸš€âœ¨
